# Validation

Automated configuration tests cover defaults, JSON persistence and replacement, invalid-file recovery/backups, missing and future fields, unknown modes, numeric boundaries, NaN/infinity, and color sanitization.

Run `./gradlew build` with JDK 21. The installable, remapped artifact is `build/libs/donut-client-1.21.0.jar`.

Run `./gradlew runClientGameTest` for isolated Minecraft runtime tests. They create disposable worlds, check finder counts/rendering, Fullbright, Freecam, Fly, Progress Bar, Name Hider, Hotbar and module keybinds, and exercise the AutoBuilder loader, popups, materials, placement, and navigation against an integrated server. Test code and fixtures are excluded from the installable jar. This requires a working graphics device.

The multiplayer Fly suite uses a dedicated server bound to localhost and logs a skip unless `build/run/clientGameTest/eula.txt` contains `eula=true`. Loom normally runs `deleteGameTestRunDir` before launch, which deletes that file along with the runtime directory. To opt in manually after reading and accepting the [Minecraft EULA](https://aka.ms/MinecraftEULA), create or edit `build/run/clientGameTest/eula.txt` with `eula=true`, then run `./gradlew runClientGameTest -x deleteGameTestRunDir` from the project root to preserve the flag. EULA acceptance is a separate user decision; the tests never create or change an acceptance flag.

## Verified on 2026-11-07 (1.21.0 Staff Detector)

- `build runClientGameTest -PstaffDetectorTestsOnly=true --offline --no-daemon` passed with JDK 21: **148 unit tests**, StaffDetectorGameTest, StaffDetectorGuiGameTest and the existing ModuleKeybindGameTest. The complete source manifest retains all 25 runtime suites. The focused flag changes processed resources only and participates in Gradle input invalidation. No dedicated-server EULA flag was created or changed.
- The disposable integrated-server connection delivered synthetic staff profiles, spectator/survival updates, player spawn/invisible metadata, entity removal, profile removal and command-completion replies through production packet mixins. Checks cover UUID binding, reported mode without inferred proximity, invisible nearby entities, bounded queue overflow, unrelated response IDs, repeated matched discrepancies, disabling checks, disable and disconnect cleanup. Matched replies use explicit test request state; this is not a capture of a remote server's completion behavior.
- Unit tests cover unresolved identities, unrelated entities, exact names, tab listing versus retained player info, finite distances/range, repeated observations, missing replies and timing gaps, hint expiry, ambiguous removals and fast reappearance, independent cooldowns, bounded notifications/history, JSON migration/persistence, strict UUID validation and server/list limits.
- Native GUI checks cover search, Favorites, completion controls, malformed names, duplicate rejection, username/UUID addition, row removal, evidence navigation, settings persistence, the real production shortcut and restoration, and GUI scales 1 and 2. Visually reviewed the HUD, roster and settings at both scales. Captures are saved as `docs/screenshots/staff-detector-*.png`.
- Inspected the remapped **1.21.0** JAR for all staff detector classes and verified it contains no unit/game-test classes. Source and release JARs are under `build/libs/`. No external-server vanish plugin, precision/recall measurement or packet-storm performance benchmark was tested. See [the Staff Detector guide](docs/staff-detector.md) for observation semantics and setup.

## Verified on 2026-11-10 (this branch, 1.21.11)

- **Compiles and passes unit tests against Minecraft 1.21.11.** `./gradlew build` on GitHub Actions (JDK 21, Temurin) completed successfully: compile, the full JUnit suite and the release jar (2.48 MB, uploaded as the `donut-client` artifact). The local sandbox can only reach GitHub/npm/PyPI, so the Minecraft, Fabric and Gradle dependencies cannot be resolved there; CI is the reference result.
- The first runs found and fixed real mapping problems in the ported engine: `StructureManager` takes `(LevelAccessor, WorldOptions, StructureCheck)` in 1.21.11, `ChunkGenerator#buildSurface`/`applyCarvers` require a `WorldGenRegion` (the full-world engine remains the one used at runtime), `LevelAccessor` rather than `LevelHeightAccessor` for the manager, a missing `BlockEspController` import in the settings screen, and `OrePredictorEngine#close()` no longer declares a checked exception.
- Three unit tests were wrong rather than the code: `AreaVerdicts.record` is a write (the verdict comes from `status()`), an unknown area reports `UNVERIFIED` instead of null, and the search test placed emerald columns off the 32-block sampling grid.
- New tests in this branch: `AreaVerdictsTest`, `MinedEvidenceTest`, `NearestEmeraldSearchTest`, `BlockEspHudLinesTest`, plus engine/area preferences in `BlockEspSettingsTest`.
- Still outstanding: the BlockESP game test (fresh vanilla chunk comparison, area verdicts from placed ore, mined test, emerald card) has **not** been run, and the ported `SeedTerrain` engine has not yet been compared chunk-for-chunk against fresh vanilla generation at runtime. Marker output is original-generation prediction only.

## Verified on 2026-11-06 (1.20.0 BlockESP)

- `build runClientGameTest -PblockEspTestsOnly=true --offline --no-daemon` passed with JDK 21: **133 unit tests**, BlockEspGameTest, BlockEspGuiGameTest, and the existing ModuleKeybindGameTest. The source test manifest retains the complete suite; the focused flag changes processed test resources only. The release JAR contains version **1.20.0** and excludes test classes.
- The predictor exactly matched **21 target ore blocks across nine freshly generated normal vanilla chunks at negative coordinates**, using the full seed **6608149111735331168**. Separate block fixtures verify both deepslate variants, exclude regular emerald/coal, and include deepslate emerald below Y=0 and deepslate coal above Y=0. This is an integrated-world result, not a claim of testing an external server or every generation version.
- Unit tests cover full 64-bit string persistence, signed minimum/maximum seeds, overflow and malformed input, missing/null preferences, bounded settings, exact block filters, and nearest-first negative-coordinate scheduling. Runtime checks cover target filtering, seed-change invalidation, stale-work suppression after disable, invalid seed reporting, and disconnect cleanup. Both runtime scratch roots were empty after shutdown.
- Native UI checks cover search, independent ore switches, Favorites persistence, the seed editor's overflow rejection and exact signed-minimum round trip, tracers/HUD preferences, shortcuts and restoration, and GUI scales 1 and 2. The existing keybind suite also passes. Visually reviewed through-terrain outlines, centered tracers, coordinates/distance HUD, and module inspectors; captures are saved as `docs/screenshots/blockesp-predictions.png`, `blockesp-settings.png`, and `blockesp-settings-scale2.png`.
- Remaining scope: no external-server session, older-chunk generator, custom/independently seeded generation, or long-distance throughput/memory benchmark was performed. All markers describe original generation. See [the BlockESP guide](docs/blockesp.md) for range, version, cancellation and cache behavior.

## Verified on 2026-11-06 (1.19.0 Sound Detector)

- `build runClientGameTest -PsoundDetectorTestsOnly=true --offline --no-daemon` passed with JDK 21: **128 unit tests**, SoundDetectorGameTest, SoundDetectorGuiGameTest, and the existing ModuleKeybindGameTest. The focused flag changes processed test resources only; the source manifest retains the complete suite, and a normal run invalidates/restores processed resources automatically. No dedicated-server EULA acceptance was created or changed.
- The real integrated-server connection delivered chest block events from **40 blocks**, plus piston and note-block actions at 44 and 48 blocks. The test triggered container/server block logic and redstone, exercised production packet mixins and the detector, and retained unknown attribution for an unbound chest event. A separate explicitly constructed positional packet verified observation while Minecraft master audio was muted. This is a local fixture result, not a claim about any external server's delivery radius.
- Catalog tests bootstrap the game registries and verify a coverage row for every registered block, material mappings for all states, shared-sound ambiguity, unknown custom/lookalike IDs, and separation of environmental versus manipulation cues. Engine fixtures verify direct versus unknown attribution, different actors, explicit self/non-player cancellation, cross-route reconciliation, adjacent sources, local evidence, negative coordinates, global effects, range/height, machinery caps, quiet diagnostics, bounded queues/history, mute/acknowledgement/expiry, rule windows/outputs/conditions, configurable grouping, and safe block-tag resolver behavior.
- Settings tests cover legacy/null/missing values, malformed finite numbers, presets preserving user appearance/rules, independent profile copies, persistence and import bounds. The UI suite exercises actual native widgets for settings, invalid numeric input, guided rule creation/toggle, expected areas, valid/invalid JSON import, nine anchors, drag/keyboard movement, and responsive previews at GUI scales 1 and 2. Existing shortcut, key capture, held-input suppression, array-list and F1 checks pass.
- Visually reviewed the runtime alert, module inspector, drag editor, appearance controls, rule list, and critical preview in a 960x640 window. Preview uses the current templates and privacy settings, and does not enter detection history. Reviewed screenshots are saved under `docs/screenshots/sound-detector-*.png`.
- The final remapped JAR reports version **1.19.0**, contains the detector/engine/HUD/packet mixins and assets, and excludes game-test/unit-test classes. Final source and release artifact are both available under `build/libs/`.
- Remaining validation: no external-server capture, simultaneous second-client attribution session, exhaustive real interaction fixture for every special block, or published packet-storm CPU/memory benchmark was performed. The runtime coverage export explicitly distinguishes generic material indexing from special routes still requiring review. Occlusion-based rules are not included; existing rules use observed identity, source, block/tag, position and timing. Server-specific filters and actual two-player behavior require a later live session.

On this Windows host, JDK selector initialization failed when Java's local socket directory used the long default temporary path. The successful test runs set `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` to a quoted `-Djdk.net.unixdomain.tmpdir=` value pointing at the existing workspace `tmp` directory. No system-wide Java or firewall settings were changed.

## Verified on 2026-10-31 (1.18.0 Spectre AutoBuild and Light Debug)

- Build, game-test compilation and all **88 unit tests** passed with JDK 21. New tests cover Sponge v2/v3 offsets and properties, malformed/overflowed block data, packed palette boundaries, material stack sizes and shulker allocation, saved-job file hashes and path confinement, Light Debug denoise/exposed-cell limits, light-level grading and preference migration/persistence.
- Seven focused Minecraft suites pass across completed runs: SpectreBuilder, SpectreBuilderGui, LightDebug, AutoBuilderData, AutoBuilderGui, AutoBuilderEngine and DonutClient. The original builder's materials, Creative/Survival placements, multi-block states, support/navigation and server-packet confirmation regressions remain passing. The main ClickGUI suite includes all twelve modules, independent inspectors, glass resource lifecycle, multiple display scales, settings, native input and donut animation.
- The source executor is exercised with a real integrated server, normal ground movement, exact directional states, repeater delay, water buckets, dry-then-waterlogged slab placement, pause/resume/cancel and its Creative restriction. The native GUI imports a compressed Sponge file, selects both executors, saves/restores origin/rotation/mirroring, chooses a saved plan, displays shulker packing, handles quick R/Enter placement keys and rejects a changed schematic. Restoring or positioning never starts construction.
- Light Debug is exercised using synthetic received block/sky-light packets in a disposable underground fixture: disabled state, weak-source denoise, filtering changes, strong source, skylight veto and clearing. Native settings, favorites, persistence and the real production shortcut pass. The native renderer is visually reviewed in `light-debug-01-underground.png` and `light-debug-02-settings.png`. These checks do not claim remote-server testing.
- Initial GUI validation exposed a missed short key tap in polling-based placement controls; queued keyboard events corrected it. One combined run then hit Fabric's network-synchronizer state error while opening the next world. A clean five-suite retry passed with synchronization still enabled. Test fixtures and modified runtime entrypoints remain separate from release code; the complete registry contains 19 suites. The final release build and two-suite Creative/GUI rerun also passed, including waterlogging and short key taps. The JAR and matching source artifact were checked for both ports, the placement mixin, source notices and exclusion of test code.

## Verified on 2026-10-31 (1.17.0 dark gradient glass and Amethyst Scanner)

- Build, game-test compilation and all 78 unit tests passed with JDK 21. Added coverage for all three amethyst methods, defaults, persistence and invalid values, plus independent discoveries-panel gradient colors/opacity and numeric recovery. Existing configuration, targeting and card-fitting tests remain passing.
- Five focused Minecraft suites passed in one completed run: Amethyst, ChunkFinder, ChunkFinderDepth, ChunkFinderGui and DonutClient. The amethyst suite verifies received-palette markers in two chunks, added tracer pixels, a synthetic hidden-bud light maximum and the ANBS signature. A solid geode block excludes one of the fixture's 18 candidate air cells, leaving 17 markers; minimum-cell changes reject and restore that result. A denser light packet reaches the source's 200-marker-per-chunk cap, and clearing light removes the markers.
- Actual GUI input verifies all three amethyst modes, conditional Min Cells, tracer and favorite saving, Visual/search/Favorites membership and shortcut capture. The saved production shortcut enables/disables the real module and produces its HUD entry. Disable and distant-chunk unloading clear findings. Light fixtures are synthetic packets from a disposable integrated server; external anti-xray implementations were not tested.
- Visually reviewed the dark charcoal/navy gradient across the ClickGUI, controls and color popup, plus the discoveries card's live frosted scene, Geist typography and dividers. A bright blue workspace preference leaves the alert dark. GUI input edits both alert colors and its opacity. Existing Base Finder object counts, grouping, maturity, live updates and ANBS refresh pass with the new material. Previews include `dark-glass-discoveries.png`, `dark-glass-geode.png`, `dark-glass-alert-controls.png`, `dark-gradient-clickgui.png`, `dark-gradient-compact.png`, `dark-gradient-colorpicker.png` and `amethyst-*.png` under `docs/screenshots/`.
- The main GUI suite verifies all eleven modules, wide/compact layouts, Minecraft GUI scales 1 and 2, enlarged interface scale, modal input, saved appearance controls, particles, reduced-motion donut behavior and glass texture allocation/release. Existing shortcuts retain their module indices; Amethyst Scanner is appended at index 10.
- Inspected the installable 1.17.0 JAR and matching source artifact for the scanner, settings, native renderer/shader changes and GPL attribution. Test classes are excluded and the complete 16-entry runtime registry was restored. The first light fixture expectation was corrected for its solid-block obstruction before the successful run.

## Verified on 2026-10-31 (1.16.0 Spectre Sus Chunk Finder)

- Build, game-test compilation and all 73 unit tests passed with JDK 21. New configuration coverage verifies all three methods, independent category colors/toggles, growth and maturity limits, invalid-value recovery and preservation of older activation/filter preferences. Targeting tests cover exact hits, near-crosshair candidates, range, objects behind the camera and inspecting from inside a formation. A sizing regression verifies large inspection cards fit screen margins at GUI scales 1-4.
- Three focused Minecraft suites passed across two runs: ChunkFinder, ChunkFinderDepth and ChunkFinderGui. Object fixtures verify containers, machines, hoppers, redstone, ender storage, both spawner types and armor stands. Measured kelp/vine/cave-vine/bamboo lengths reject short growth; berry changes retain the cave-vine texture and measured length. Connected amethyst across chunk borders reports separate crystal stages and exact maturity, responds to live growth and threshold/filter changes, and includes immature formations only when selected.
- Classic scoring checks cover threshold changes and an attached bud whose support is in the adjacent chunk. Replacing that support refreshes the neighboring chunk classification. Breaking a container updates its count, range limits exclude distant markers, disabling clears results, and teleporting away unloads the activity reports. Below-zero fixtures verify formations across negative chunk coordinates and a bee clue at Y=-63.
- ANBS checks use actual received synthetic server light packets in a disposable integrated world: three isolated level-four light cells produce 18 qualifying edge cells and 18 inspectable anomaly markers. Switching methods and a clearing light packet remove the markers. Ordinary vanilla lighting does not produce those fixture anomalies. The port waits for Minecraft 1.21.11's deferred light tasks and light-engine work before rescanning; no remote server or DonutFolia-branded endpoint was tested.
- GUI input verifies all three method choices, conditional activity/packet thresholds, range, inspection controls, category selection, the seven clue filters, favorites, category search, clipping, shortcut capture/save/repeat suppression and actual activation at GUI scales 1 and 2. Visually reviewed object, geode, growth and ANBS cards plus the settings/filter inspector. Previews are saved as `spectre-basefinder-*.png` under `docs/screenshots/`.
- Inspected the installable 1.16.0 JAR and matching source artifact: the scanner, grouping/light helpers, native inspection card, new packet/projection mixins, previous glass/privacy renderers and GPL attribution are included; test classes are excluded. The full 15-entry runtime registry was restored after focused runs. Initial fixture and automatic-GUI-scale failures were corrected before the successful runs.

## Verified on 2026-10-31 (1.15.0 frosted liquid glass and empty hands)

- Build and all 68 unit tests passed with JDK 21. Configuration coverage verifies glass defaults on for older configurations, the solid-surface preference persists, and held-item hiding defaults off and saves independently of Hotbar activation.
- Three focused Minecraft suites passed: DonutClient, Hotbar and NameHider. The GUI suite checks live glass allocation at half the framebuffer size, reallocation after resizing, release when disabled or closed, and restoration when enabled. Existing wide/compact layouts, large UI scale, control input, scrolling, color popups, particle preferences and reduced-motion donut checks pass. The GUI suite was repeated after rounding the color modal's dimmed backdrop.
- Empty-hand pixel comparisons cover a diamond sword, bow and building blocks with an offhand shield. Hidden views match the ordinary empty fist, including with Hotbar blur at 0%. Third-person render states contain no held items, and normal equipment reappears when the option is disabled. Both client and server retain the real selected item and shield; ordinary block use still places the expected block on the server.
- Existing Hotbar 0-140% item/count/name blur, Creative/Survival HUD protection, shortcut saving, F1 behavior, texture release and menu ordering pass. Whole-scoreboard blur, restoration, username-only sanitization and unchanged scoreboard data also pass at GUI scales 1 and 2.
- Visually reviewed the glass workspace, compact layout, controls and color picker, plus first- and third-person empty hands. Previews are saved as `liquid-glass-clickgui.png`, `liquid-glass-compact.png`, `liquid-glass-appearance.png`, `liquid-glass-colorpicker.png`, `empty-hands.png`, `held-items-visible.png`, `empty-hands-settings.png` and `empty-hands-third-person.png` under `docs/screenshots/`.
- Inspected the installable 1.15.0 JAR and matching source artifact for the new mixins, glass shaders and existing visual renderers; test code remains excluded. The full 15-entry runtime-test registry was restored. An initial multi-world run hit Fabric's network-synchronizer race; the successful reruns kept synchronization enabled. External rendering mods and shader packs were outside this validation pass.

## Verified on 2026-10-31 (1.14.0 Spectre array list, donut and scoreboard privacy)

- Build and all 67 unit tests passed with JDK 21. New configuration coverage verifies that whole-scoreboard blur defaults to off in older configurations, persists when enabled and remains selected when Name Hider is disabled.
- Four focused Minecraft suites passed: DonutClient, NameHider, ModuleKeybind and Hotbar. The main GUI suite verifies changing pixels in both spinning-donut regions and identical pixels with animation speed set to zero, alongside the existing wide/compact GUI controls. The module-keybind suite verifies the live array list contains the enabled modules, settles its animations and sorts by rendered width at GUI scales 1 and 2.
- Whole-scoreboard tests verify blurred sidebar pixels and loss of text-edge detail at GUI scales 1 and 2, unchanged pixels outside the sidebar, restoration on disable, texture release, and identical client/server scoreboard data. The original username-only sanitizer, GUI preference saving and shortcut checks also pass. Hotbar's 0-140% item/name blur, Survival HUD protection and menu ordering pass after sharing the cached blur implementation.
- Visually reviewed the lit donut in the category banner and name logo, connected Spectre array-list rows, new Name Hider toggle and full-sidebar blur. Saved previews as `donut-clickgui.png`, `spectre-arraylist.png`, `namehider-full-scoreboard-settings.png`, `scoreboard-unblurred.png` and `scoreboard-full-blur.png` under `docs/screenshots/`.
- The installable 1.14.0 JAR and matching source artifact include the new renderers and notices. The generated 15-entry game-test registry was restored after the focused run; test classes remain excluded from the mod JAR.

## Verified on 2026-10-31 (1.13.1 Hotbar item-name blur and 140% maximum)

- Build, all 66 unit tests, and game-test compilation passed with JDK 21. Hotbar configuration tests verify that existing 90% settings are retained, 110% and 140% persist, and edited values clamp to 0-140%.
- The focused Hotbar Minecraft suite passed at GUI scales 1 and 2. It exercises the real slider through the 140% endpoint, production shortcut activation, persistence, and actual item/count/offhand pixels at 0%, 30%, 90%, 100% and 140%. Pixel checks verify 140% removes more detail than the previous maximum, and 0% restores the original output.
- Slot-switch tests cover ordinary names and a long, bold renamed item in Creative and Survival. Screenshots verify names blur at 90% and lose readable character edges at 140%, disabling restores sharp text, and the 182-pixel health/hunger/experience area stays clear. Expiring the selected-item name releases its blur textures while the hotbar remains active. Existing F1, resource release and menu-above-HUD checks pass. The full generated test registry was restored afterward.
- The renderer uses separate boundaries for the hotbar and its selected-item name, preserving the normal experience-bar draw order. Each region reuses its own pair of small textures. Values above 100% add another separable blur pair to increase the maximum radius by 40%; existing 0-100% blending is retained.
- Visually reviewed the new 140% settings and actual blurred names/items. Previews are saved as `docs/screenshots/hotbar-140-settings.png`, `hotbar-name-clear.png` and `hotbar-name-blur140.png`. Inspected the remapped 1.13.1 JAR: version, updated shader, mixins and renderer are included; test classes are excluded.

## Verified on 2026-10-31 (1.13.0 Spectre visual port)

- `build compileGametestJava processGametestResources --offline --no-daemon` passed with JDK 21 and all 66 unit tests. New presentation tests cover older/null configurations, preservation of saved module values and accent colors, style persistence, and invalid numeric values.
- Ten GUI-related Minecraft runtime suites passed across two focused runs: DonutClient, ProgressBar, ModuleKeybind, AutoBuilderGui, ChunkFinderGui, Hotbar, Fullbright, Fly, Freecam and NameHider. The main GUI suite was repeated after the final large-scale layout correction. Both generated test registries were restored after the runs. The remaining runtime suites were outside this visual-port validation pass.
- The main suite verifies tile selection without activation or saves, separate activation switches, independent inspector scrolling, dropdowns, sliders, favorites, shortcut capture, category search, Ctrl+F, Enabled only, modal input blocking, particle persistence, HUD controls, and surface color/opacity changes. Existing specialized suites verify progress counts/timers and overlay editing, schematic manager interactions, hotbar rendering, movement/camera behavior and sidebar privacy through the new GUI.
- Visually reviewed actual 1920 x 1080 and 1280 x 800 captures at Minecraft GUI scales 1 and 2, plus the largest 150% UI setting. Verified the original procedural ghost renders correctly with Minecraft's triangle winding. Large UI scales enlarge geometry with typography, preventing overlapping header and inspector labels. Six previews are saved as `docs/screenshots/spectre-*.png`, including `spectre-clickgui.png`.
- Compared 66 existing Java entries in the prior and final remapped source JARs, excluding the intentionally replaced `DonutScreen` presentation and `ClientConfig` presentation preferences: no changes. This includes all 55 existing backend files and the other existing GUI implementations.
- Inspected the remapped `donut-client-1.13.0.jar`: version, Geist fonts, native mascot, particles and attribution/license resources are included; game-test classes are excluded. The matching source artifact is `build/libs/donut-client-1.13.0-sources.jar`.

## Verified on 2026-10-30 (1.12.0 workspace ClickGUI)

- Build, all 63 unit tests, and game-test compilation passed with JDK 21. Configuration checks verify ambient particles default to enabled for older files and a disabled preference survives saving and loading. Existing saved accent colors are preserved; new configurations use lime.
- The focused `DonutClientGameTest` Minecraft suite passed. It exercises opening/closing fades, reversible inline expansion, category navigation, search, favorites, setting sliders, modal color editing, and input clipping at GUI scales 1 and 2. New runtime checks verify Enabled only hides disabled modules without saving module changes, and the Ambient particles switch saves both states. The generated test registry was restored after the run.
- Visually reviewed the actual module list, expanded settings, Appearance, and color modal. Warm espresso surfaces, ivory text, lime accents, and blue branding remain consistent over the bright showcase scene. Twenty-four faint motes drift outside the workspace and share its opening/closing opacity. Previews are saved as `docs/screenshots/clickgui-workspace*.png`.
- Inspected the remapped `donut-client-1.12.0.jar`: the new screen and particle renderer are included, the version is correct, and test classes are excluded.

## Verified on 2026-10-18 (1.11.1 adjustable Hotbar blur)

- `build compileGametestJava processGametestResources --offline --no-daemon`: passed with JDK 21 and all 63 unit tests. Blur defaults to 90% for existing configurations, saves independently of activation, and clamps edited values to 0-100%.
- The focused Hotbar Minecraft suite passed using the generated test registry; the complete registry was restored afterward. The actual slider selects and saves 35% and 65% at GUI scales 1 and 2. Pixel checks verify progressively stronger blur at 30%, 90% and 100%, a clear hotbar with released GPU resources at 0%, and unchanged scene pixels outside the hotbar. Existing shortcut, offhand, restoration, F1 and screen-layer checks also pass.
- Visually reviewed the new slider, its 90% label and help text, plus 30% and 100% rendered output. Updated `docs/screenshots/hotbar-streaming.png`; strength comparisons are saved as `hotbar-blur30.png` and `hotbar-blur100.png`. Packaged the remapped 1.11.1 JAR without test classes.

## Verified on 2026-10-18 (1.11.0 Hotbar)

- `build compileGametestJava --offline --no-daemon`: passed with JDK 21 and all 62 unit tests. New settings tests verify missing/older/null configurations default to disabled and activation/favorites persist alongside the other Streaming modules.
- `runClientGameTest --offline --no-daemon`: passed the full registry with all fourteen active runtime suites. The dedicated-server Fly suite skipped because no EULA acceptance flag was present.
- The Hotbar suite verifies Streaming-only membership, search, favorites, settings expansion, GUI clipping, shortcut capture, saved activation, and held-key repeat suppression. Actual Minecraft screenshots at GUI scales 1 and 2 verify all nine item icons/counts and the offhand are blurred, sharp-edge detail is reduced, and disabling restores the original pixels. Unrelated scene pixels stay unchanged, F1 releases the blur textures, and screen overlays remain above the effect.
- The GPU blur runs after hotbar item/decorations drawing and before later HUD/screens. Two small textures are reused at GUI resolution, with a fixed 90% blurred/10% original composite restricted to the hotbar region. GPU resources are recreated when their dimensions change and released when inactive, hidden, or the renderer closes.
- Visually reviewed the Streaming card and actual blurred hotbar. Captures are saved as `docs/screenshots/hotbar-streaming.png`, `hotbar-visible.png`, and `hotbar-blurred.png`.

## Verified on 2026-10-18 (1.10.0 configurable countdowns)

- `runClientGameTest --offline --no-daemon`: passed the full registry with all thirteen active runtime suites. The dedicated-server Fly suite skipped because no EULA acceptance flag was present.
- `build compileGametestJava --offline --no-daemon`: passed with JDK 21 and all 60 unit tests. A fake monotonic clock verifies exact one-hour expiration after 3600 seconds, elapsed time without ticks, millisecond pause/resume, independent configurations and stages, reset/restart, duration bounds and paused reload. Parser tests verify `1:00:00` and `01:00:00` both mean one hour, and reject invalid minutes, seconds, zero and out-of-range durations.
- Configuration tests verify default one-hour timers for older/null/short arrays, preservation of existing values, long-millisecond persistence, and input bounds. Only duration and remaining time are saved; normal client shutdown captures and pauses all timers before saving. Rendering and tick frequency do not determine countdown speed.
- The expanded Minecraft Progress Bar suite passes typed durations, validation, Escape repeat suppression, scrolled Start/Pause/Resume/Reset controls, independent real-time advancement, paused persistence, and expiration at zero. Per-capsule screenshot checks verify that changing one timer leaves the others intact. The timer row participates in the overlay's scaling, drag bounds and viewport clamping.
- Visually reviewed the three minimal timer capsules beneath their icons, the configured one-hour display, and the settings. Captures are saved as `docs/screenshots/progressbar-timers.png` and `progressbar-timer-settings.png`. The remapped 1.10.0 JAR includes timer settings, clock and duration parser classes, with no test classes.

## Verified on 2026-10-15 (1.9.2 counter typography)

- Build and all 46 unit tests passed. The existing focused Progress Bar runtime suite passed, including manual counts, persistence, scaling and dragging. The generated test registry was restored afterward.
- Visually reviewed the bold label and red number at 27 and 999999; both fit the centered counter capsule. Text placement uses the bold label's measured width. Preview saved as `docs/screenshots/progressbar-counter-bold-red.png`.

## Verified on 2026-10-15 (1.9.1 Bases Found counter)

- `build compileGametestJava processGametestResources --offline --no-daemon`: passed with JDK 21 and all 46 unit tests. The count defaults to zero in older configurations, persists independently of milestones, and clamps to 0-999999.
- The focused Progress Bar Minecraft suite passed. It exercises typed totals, saved +/- changes, oversized and empty input, min/max boundaries, canceling edits and held-Escape repeat suppression. Dropping the footer drags and saves the complete widget, and the resized bounds keep both hexagons and counter on screen. The full generated test registry was restored after the focused run.
- Screenshot pixel checks verify 0, 27 and 999999 produce distinct counter text without changing the three icons or milestones. Visually reviewed both outline styles, the maximum value and the complete themed overlay with two marked stages. Captures are saved as `docs/screenshots/progressbar-counter.png` and `progressbar-counter-settings.png`. The remapped 1.9.1 JAR includes the new footer shader branch and excludes tests.

## Verified on 2026-10-15 (1.9.0 Name Hider)

- `build compileGametestJava --offline --no-daemon`: passed with JDK 21, including all 44 unit tests. New settings tests cover missing/older/null configurations and persisted activation/favorites alongside unchanged Progress Bar preferences.
- `runClientGameTest --offline --no-daemon`: passed all thirteen active runtime suites. The dedicated-server Fly suite skipped because no EULA acceptance flag was present.
- The new Minecraft suite verifies actual sidebar pixels with the module off, on, and disabled again. Repeated account names disappear from the title, team prefixes/suffixes, custom display names split across styles, and fixed score number formats. Other player names remain visible, panel width follows sanitized text, and disabling restores the original pixels. Client and server scoreboard text, styles, scores, and team data remain unchanged.
- Sanitizer checks cover repeated and case-insensitive matches, ASCII username boundaries, names spanning styled components, preservation of remaining glyph styles, source immutability, and unchanged no-match text. GUI checks cover Streaming-only membership, Favorites, search, settings expansion, shortcut capture, scale 2 clipping, production shortcut activation, persistence and held-key repeat suppression.
- Visually reviewed the actual module and scoreboard captures, saved as `docs/screenshots/namehider-streaming.png`, `namehider-visible.png`, and `namehider-hidden.png`. Inspected the remapped 1.9.0 JAR: Name Hider classes, mixin and original CC0 license are included, with no test classes or standalone Name Hider JAR dependency. See [integration notes](docs/name-hider-integration.md) for the source JAR's static inspection.

## Verified on 2026-10-15 (1.8.1 Progress Bar size and milestone marks)

- `build compileGametestJava processGametestResources --offline --no-daemon`: passed with JDK 21 and all 42 unit tests. Size defaults to 100%, persists through save/reload, clamps to 50-200%, and repairs non-finite values.
- The focused Progress Bar Minecraft suite passed with only its generated test entrypoint enabled for this run; the full generated test registry was restored afterward. The size slider selects and saves 125%, dragging uses the resized bounds, 50% and 200% layouts scale correctly, and enlarged overlays clamp to small viewports and screen margins.
- Pixel checks verify both diagonals of a red X above each marked block at 100% and 150%, no X on pending stages, and removal when unmarking or resetting. Visually reviewed `docs/screenshots/progressbar-size-settings.png` and `progressbar-size-marks.png`: the first milestone reads Overworld and the X is the final shader layer. The 1.8.1 remapped JAR includes the updated shader and excludes runtime-test classes.

## Verified on 2026-10-15 (1.8.0 streaming Progress Bar)

- `build compileGametestJava --offline --no-daemon`: passed with JDK 21, including all 41 unit tests. Five new configuration tests cover older/null settings, saved appearance and manual progress, stage bounds, off-screen positions, and non-finite coordinate repair.
- `runClientGameTest --offline --no-daemon`: passed all twelve active runtime suites. The dedicated-server Fly suite skipped because no EULA acceptance flag was present.
- The new Minecraft runtime suite exercises Streaming-only membership, Favorites, expansion, enable/style toggles, manual stages and reset, JSON persistence, dragging and save-on-release, and controls at GUI scales 1 and 2. Small viewport bounds remain inside the screen. Actual screenshot comparisons verify the overlay works with the module list disabled, distinguishes shiny/empty styles, and respects F1.
- Visually reviewed the actual shader output and settings. Original supplied RGBA images are bundled unchanged. Signed-distance hexagons have smooth edges, translucent shading and completed-stage accents; the optional outer frame has animated iridescent highlights. Preview captures are saved as `docs/screenshots/progressbar-settings.png`, `progressbar-shiny.png`, and `progressbar-empty.png`.
- Windows JDK startup in this environment required a short Unix-domain socket directory. Create `.tools/tmp`, then set `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` to `-Djdk.net.unixdomain.tmpdir="<absolute project path>/.tools/tmp"` before Gradle if it fails with `Unable to establish loopback connection` / `Invalid argument: connect`.

## Verified on 2026-10-12 (1.7.0 glass ClickGUI)

- `build compileGametestJava --offline --no-daemon`: passed with JDK 21, including all 36 unit tests. `runClientGameTest --offline --no-daemon`: passed all eleven runtime suites; the dedicated-server Fly suite skipped because no EULA acceptance flag was present.
- Replaced the two-column module cards with full-width rows and larger headers, module icons, descriptions, and separate shortcut/favorite/switch controls. Runtime assertions check row widths, ordering, control accessibility, non-overlapping controls, and input clipping at GUI scales 1 and 2. Expanded rows remain independently open and their settings are reachable by scrolling.
- Added a GPU glass shader with scene blur, edge refraction, subtle dispersion, rounded antialiased coverage, and reflected highlights. Two half-resolution blur passes are shared by all glass panels per frame. Runtime assertions verify allocated texture dimensions and release after closing; shader compilation and GUI rendering completed successfully on the local graphics device.
- Visually reviewed the actual Visual and Blatant rows, expanded/scrolled settings, Appearance, and color editor. Saved a preview over a colorful in-game facade as `docs/screenshots/glass-clickgui.png`, with expanded settings and modal previews alongside it. Existing shortcuts, favorites, search, module functionality, and AutoBuilder manager checks remain passing.
- Inspected the remapped 1.7.0 JAR: glass shader assets and GUI renderer mixin are included; test classes are excluded. Third-party shader packs and alternate renderers were not tested.

## Verified on 2026-10-10 (1.6.1 multiplayer Fly)

- `build runClientGameTest --offline --no-daemon`: passed with JDK 21. All 36 unit tests and the eleven existing Minecraft runtime suites passed. The dedicated-server multiplayer suite was skipped at the user's request; no EULA acceptance flag was set.
- Removed the singleplayer and unpublished-LAN activation restrictions. Remote sessions use vanilla client abilities and ordinary packets, while hosted worlds still grant flight only to the local owner. A client ability-packet mixin retains the remote server's latest flight flags for restoration. Actual remote movement, server permission updates, and LAN publication remain unverified in this run.
- Regression checks confirm hosted Survival movement, ability restoration across game modes, temporary-flight save protection, death/respawn/disconnect cleanup, and the existing GUI/shortcut/HUD integrations. Disconnect cleanup now matches its connection, runs on the client thread, and avoids sending ability packets after disconnect.
- Visually reviewed the updated Blatant Fly card and saved `docs/screenshots/fly-blatant.png`. Inspected the remapped 1.6.1 JAR: both flight mixins are included and test/game-test classes are excluded. Remote servers may restrict flight or correct movement.

## Verified on 2026-10-09 (1.6.0 Fly)

- `build runClientGameTest --offline --no-daemon`: passed with JDK 21. All 36 unit tests and all eleven Minecraft runtime suites passed, including transient Fly activation, persistent favorites, older/null settings, and saving preferences during active flight.
- Production Fly is in Blatant and supports Favorites, an assignable Controls shortcut, settings expansion, held-key repeat suppression, and the active-module HUD. Visually reviewed the actual Blatant card and Survival flight screenshots, saved as `docs/screenshots/fly-blatant.png` and `fly-survival.png`.
- Disposable Survival-world checks verify both client and integrated-server flight permission, real forward/up/down movement, hovering, ordinary camera attachment, and gravity after disabling. Game mode, movement speeds, and unrelated abilities remain unchanged.
- Runtime checks preserve previously grounded and airborne Creative abilities and Spectator flight, restore the correct baseline after game-mode changes, and clear activation on death, respawn, and disconnect.
- Saved actual player data while Fly was active and read its compressed NBT: Survival flight flags remain disabled in the saved file while live flight stays enabled. The save mixin masks only temporary flight flags; it does not mutate live abilities.
- Inspected the remapped release JAR: version 1.6.0, Fly controller/settings/save mixin and translated Controls label present, and no test/game-test classes. Remote servers, LAN publication, dimension changes, and third-party movement mods were not exercised by this test.

## Verified on 2026-10-09 (1.5.1 Base Finder layers)

- `build runClientGameTest --offline --no-daemon`: passed with JDK 21. All 33 unit tests and all ten Minecraft runtime suites passed.
- Removed the world-height guide added in 1.4.2. The overlay retains a 16x16 chunk footprint but follows only contiguous observed evidence heights, with 0.05-block Y padding, one-pixel outlines, and fill at six percent of the configured alpha. Separate evidence depths do not bridge empty vertical space.
- Loaded-world checks verify a buried Y=-32 layer from the surface and nearby, through-wall GPU submission, exact color/alpha/fill, and two separate layers at Y=-40 and -8 within one chunk. Existing negative-Y detection and growth-stage regressions still pass. Unit tests cover immutable layer snapshots, negative/empty bounds and invalid reversed layers.
- Verified the Base Finder card, `basefinder` search, translated Controls name, settings/filters, favorites, shortcut capture/persistence/repeat suppression, and production HUD. Original JSON and shortcut identifiers are unchanged so existing preferences and keys remain compatible.
- Visually reviewed actual screenshots at GUI scales 1 and 2, the renamed HUD, and compact underground/separated layers. Representative images are saved in `docs/screenshots/basefinder-*.png`.
- The first runtime attempt found an integer teleport-centering mismatch in the new test camera setup. Corrected the test coordinate to an explicit decimal and reran the full suite successfully; production code was unchanged.
- Inspected the remapped release JAR: version 1.5.1, evidence-layer class and Base Finder Controls label present, and no test/game-test classes. Third-party shader packs and alternate renderers remain untested.

## Verified on 2026-10-09 (1.5.0 Fullbright)

- `build runClientGameTest --offline --no-daemon`: passed with JDK 21. All 30 unit tests and all ten Minecraft runtime suites passed.
- Fullbright applies gamma 1000 only to the lightmap's brightness read. The normal brightness option remains unchanged, including while saving/reloading options or editing brightness with Fullbright enabled. Disabling returns to the current normal brightness.
- Runtime checks used the production module, GUI and shortcuts in a disposable, unlit singleplayer room. Screenshot pixel checks confirm the room becomes bright without an all-white frame and returns to its original darkness after disabling. No Night Vision effect was present.
- Verified Visual/Favorites membership, exclusion from Blatant, gamma search, inline settings, key capture/persistence, shortcut activation and held-key repeat suppression, and input clipping at GUI scales 1 and 2. Configuration tests cover missing/older/null settings and enabled/favorite persistence.
- Visually reviewed screenshots at both GUI scales and the off/on/restored room captures. Representative images are saved as `docs/screenshots/fullbright-clickgui.png`, `fullbright-scaled.png`, `fullbright-off.png`, `fullbright-on.png`, and `fullbright-restored.png`.
- Inspected the remapped release JAR: version 1.5.0, Fullbright classes and its lightmap mixin present, and no test/game-test classes. Third-party shader packs and alternate renderers remain untested.

## Verified on 2026-10-09 (1.4.2 underground amethyst)

- Reproduced the old Smart Adjustment bug in an actual loaded singleplayer world: only mature-cluster fixtures at Y=4, -17 and -63 matched, while small, medium, large and mixed-stage fixtures were discarded. Negative-Y section mapping was correct; the mature-cluster ratio filter caused the misses.
- Removed that ratio filter while preserving stage weights and sensitivity thresholds. Maximum sensitivity now also accepts a lone growing bud. Smart Adjustment continues to ignore bare amethyst/budding blocks.
- `build runClientGameTest --offline --no-daemon`: passed with JDK 21. All 28 unit tests and all nine Minecraft runtime suites passed.
- Depth regression checks exact evidence heights at Y=4, -2, -3, -16, -17, -32, -48 and -63, mixed-stage geodes, updates from small buds to mature clusters, lone buds at maximum sensitivity, and bare-block suppression after replacing a detected cluster.
- Added a full-build-height wireframe guide without column fill. The runtime test inspects actual rendered frame data and the GPU line buffer for buried Y=-32 amethyst viewed from Y=65. It verifies chunk bounds, alpha/color, and through-wall rendering. Visually reviewed the surface screenshot saved as `docs/screenshots/chunkfinder-underground-surface.png`.
- Inspected the remapped release JAR: version 1.4.2, Chunk Finder classes present, and no test/game-test classes. The user's specific world was not inspected; all reproductions used disposable worlds with known, loaded fixtures.

## Verified on 2026-10-07 (1.4.1 placement packets)

- `build runClientGameTest --offline --no-daemon`: passed with JDK 21. All 28 unit tests and all eight Minecraft runtime suites passed.
- A regression run with the old placement path reproduced two regular movement packets in one client tick. The corrected production path completed 29 placement interactions across 544 client ticks with at most one regular movement packet per tick and positive, strictly increasing placement sequences. Vanilla teleport responses are excluded from the regular-movement count.
- Placement now waits for vanilla's transmitted rotation and sneak input. Runtime checks passed for directional blocks, configurable redstone, slabs, paired blocks, cancel/reselect before server confirmation, temporary supports, obstacle navigation, server position corrections, menu/Freecam pauses, missing materials, and authoritative rejection.
- Inspected the remapped release JAR: version 1.4.1, the new player-state accessor registered and correctly remapped, AutoBuilder and Chunk Finder classes present, and no test classes or test mixin resources.
- One retry encountered a Fabric network-synchronizer race during world teardown before the engine suite. The unchanged rerun passed with network synchronization enabled. The user's private server and its anti-cheat plugin have not been directly tested.

## Verified on 2026-10-07 (1.4.0 Chunk Finder)

- `build runClientGameTest --offline --no-daemon`: passed with JDK 21. All 28 unit tests and all eight Minecraft runtime suites passed.
- Chunk Finder configuration tests cover defaults, older/null configurations, numeric boundaries, color sanitization, and persistence of every filter and setting.
- Loaded-world fixtures verify all seven indicator types independently, sensitivity thresholds, smart suppression of mixed-stage geodes, simulation-distance bounds, evidence removal, disable/clear/disconnect cleanup, and scan progress while crossing chunk boundaries every tick.
- Production GUI input verifies Visual/Favorites membership, exclusion from Blatant, search, inline expansion, all sliders/filters, saved shortcuts, actual shortcut activation and repeat suppression. Input clipping was checked at GUI scales 1 and 2.
- Visually reviewed actual menu screenshots at both scales and chunk overlays at alpha 80 and 160. Previews are saved in `docs/screenshots/chunkfinder-clickgui.png`, `chunkfinder-filters.png`, `chunkfinder-scaled.png`, and `chunkfinder-overlay.png`.
- Inspected the remapped JAR: version 1.4.0, Chunk Finder classes present, and no test/game-test classes. Detections remain heuristic and can include natural terrain. External servers, shader packs and alternate renderers remain untested.

The Freecam runtime test compares both the actual client player and integrated server player before and after camera movement, checks speed/boost/vertical movement and mouse look, verifies action queues are cleared, and checks that disabling restores normal input without undoing a server teleport. It also checks disconnect cleanup and clicks the Freecam GUI controls. Configuration tests cover persistence of speed/favorites and deliberately non-persistent activation.

## Verified on 2026-10-05 (1.3.1 categories)

- `build runClientGameTest --offline`: passed; all 24 unit tests and all six Minecraft runtime suites passed.
- Verified AutoBuilder appears only under Blatant and its Favorites entry, while Visual contains the finders and Freecam. Category fades, scoped search, keybind capture, and AutoBuilder popup controls remain working.
- Visually reviewed the new sidebar and Blatant card in Minecraft. Updated `docs/screenshots/autobuilder-clickgui.png` and verified the installable JAR reports version 1.3.1 with no test classes.

## Verified on 2026-10-05 (1.3.0 AutoBuilder)

- `build runClientGameTest --offline`: passed on Windows with JDK 21, Minecraft 1.21.11, Fabric Loader 0.18.4, and Fabric API 0.141.4+1.21.11. All 24 unit tests and all six Minecraft runtime suites passed.
- Loader tests cover compressed/uncompressed `.litematic`, multiple signed-size regions, packed entries crossing 64-bit boundaries, block-entity validation, identical/conflicting overlaps including chests with different region origins, malformed palettes/properties/lengths, data-version and volume bounds, and a 65,536-block file.
- Material tests cover exact states, partial double slabs, stacked candles, paired/orphan blocks, hotbar versus inventory, offhand exclusion, and genuinely unloaded chunks. Incremental scans match synchronous results, obey cell budgets, publish only completed snapshots, and cancel on context changes or disconnect.
- GUI tests cover the fourth module and its real keybind, favorites, valid/invalid library selection and Refresh, previous/next, coordinates, rotation/mirroring, drag/zoom, popup fades and modal input, search, Creative access and capacity, and production ghost-preview controls. Visually reviewed actual screenshots at GUI scales 1 and 2; representative images are in `docs/screenshots/`.
- Production placement tests confirm server states for ordinary blocks, double/top slabs, directional and upside-down stairs, snow layers, repeater delay, comparator mode, redstone wire, doors, beds, and tall plants. A cancel/reselect regression verifies predicted secondary cells do not count before acknowledgment.
- Navigation tests walk around an obstacle, replan after a server teleport, place an elevated sand block on a support column/access step, and track lateral supports. Menu/Freecam pauses restore input, missing materials pause clearly, Adventure placements remain rejected with zero progress, and disconnect stops construction.
- Inspected the remapped release JAR: version 1.3.0, Minecraft 1.21.11, AutoBuilder classes present, and no game-test/test classes.
- Multiplayer packet behavior was exercised against Minecraft's integrated server. External servers, third-party renderers, and shader packs remain untested. Placement and navigation limits are documented in `AUTOBUILDER.md`.

## Verified on 2026-10-04 (1.2.1 animations)

- `build runClientGameTest --offline`: passed; all 15 configuration tests and all three Minecraft runtime suites passed.
- Verified intermediate screen/content/color-editor fade states, delayed close removal, smooth reversal of an in-progress settings expansion, and settled card heights.
- Verified the actual Right Shift shortcut closes and immediately reopens the GUI, and module shortcuts remain usable after a fade-out. Screen removal occurs during Minecraft's input tick to preserve input suppression without discarding fresh presses.
- Existing settings, color/filter groups, favorites, search, keybind capture, persistence, Freecam, and finder rendering checks remain passing.
- Visually reviewed the 12px favorite stars aligned with the switches and the smaller 85% keybind text inside outlined boxes at GUI scale 2. Updated screenshots in `docs/screenshots/`.

## Verified on 2026-10-04 (1.2.0 compact GUI)

- `build runClientGameTest --offline`: passed with JDK 21; all 15 configuration tests and all three Minecraft runtime suites completed successfully.
- Verified right-click expands and collapses inline settings without changing activation or saving unchanged configuration. Left-click module headers and switches toggle independently.
- Verified multiple open cards, compact rendering controls, save callbacks, favorites/search, collapsible color/filter groups, and modal color editing.
- Verified scrolled filter controls, viewport input clipping, and opening/collapsing cards at GUI scale 2. Existing keyboard/mouse binding capture, persistence, Freecam, and finder rendering tests also passed.
- Visually reviewed the actual in-game compact overview and expanded settings screenshots, saved in `docs/screenshots/clickgui.png` and `docs/screenshots/clickgui-expanded.png`.
- Confirmed the installable jar reports version 1.2.0 and contains no game-test classes. Third-party renderers and shader packs were not tested.

## Verified on 2026-09-27

- `build`: passed; all 15 configuration tests passed.
- `runClientGameTest`: all three runtime suites passed (finders, Freecam, and module keybinds).
- Assigned keys to all three modules through the production click GUI; verified keyboard/mouse capture, Escape cancellation (including key repeat), Delete/Backspace clearing, `options.txt` persistence, and reloading through Minecraft Options.
- Verified real shortcuts toggle each module, native key repeats do not retoggle a held binding, menu input does not replay after closing, and holding Sprint across menu closure does not block shortcuts.
- Reviewed captured GUI screenshots at GUI scales 1 and 2, including the scaled binding-capture control. Rounded edges and icons use antialiased geometry.
- Reviewed the names-only array list at both scales and confirmed F1 hides it. All-disabled state was also captured.
- Updated representative screenshots in `docs/screenshots/`. Third-party renderers and shader packs were not tested.

## Verified on 2026-09-23

- `build`: passed; all 15 configuration tests passed, including Freecam settings persistence, disabled activation on load, and numeric sanitization.
- `runClientGameTest`: both the finder and Freecam runtime suites passed on Windows with Minecraft 1.21.11, Fabric Loader 0.18.4 and Fabric API 0.141.4+1.21.11.
- GUI module switches, mode selection, opacity input, save callbacks, and Freecam speed/boost sliders passed assertions.
- All seven target types and dropper filtering passed loaded-world assertions.
- Captured all six combinations of render mode and depth policy. Visual review confirmed outlines, fill, and wall occlusion. Representative screenshots are in `docs/screenshots/`.
- Freecam forward, sprint-boosted, and vertical movement passed while both the actual client player and integrated-server player retained their positions and rotations. Real mouse input and direct camera rotation also preserved both player poses.
- Freecam interaction queues were cleared; disabling restored the original player input and camera. A server teleport received during Freecam remained authoritative after disabling, and disconnect cleanup reset activation.
- External multiplayer servers, third-party shader packs, and alternate renderers have not been tested.

## Gameplay checks

Use a separate creative singleplayer world with commands enabled:

1. Open the Donut title-screen button and check the compact two-column module grid, sidebar and typography. Right-click each header to expand/collapse its settings without changing activation; left-click the header or switch to toggle the module. Verify keybinds and stars keep their separate actions. Enter a world and open the GUI with Right Shift.
2. Place a chest, double chest, trapped chest, ender chest, regular and colored shulker boxes, dropper, monster spawner and trial spawner. Dispensers should not match the dropper filter.
3. Enable each finder independently; switch between Outline, Filled and Both. Verify the outlines track the block shapes while walking and turning the camera.
4. Place an opaque wall between the player and targets. Toggle Through walls to compare rendering with and without depth testing.
5. Set each opacity to zero and full, and compare line widths. Change base and family colors using presets, RGB sliders and hex entry.
6. Turn each filter off and confirm only the corresponding blocks disappear. Break a highlighted block; its highlight should disappear immediately.
7. Reduce range and walk across its boundary. Test distance fading, unload chunks, and change dimension/world; previous-world targets should disappear.
8. Expand multiple cards, scroll all settings, use favorites/search, edit the accent and HUD setting, close/reopen, and restart the game to check persistence. Check the compact Colors and Block filters groups. Test another window size and GUI scale, including clicks near the clipped top/bottom of the module viewport.
9. Assign each module's key in the click GUI and confirm the same binding appears in Minecraft Controls. Test keyboard and mouse bindings, Escape to cancel, Delete/Backspace to clear, conflicts, and persistence after restarting. Capturing a binding must not toggle its module; shortcuts must stay inactive in chat and menus.
10. Enable the finder modules and Freecam, then check the array list at the top right: names only, longest first, with soft shadows and no solid box or counters. AutoBuilder appears while construction runs. Disable modules and the Array list appearance option, and check F1 hides the HUD.
11. Inspect rounded corners, favorite/search/module icons, toggle movement, and scrolling at GUI scales 1 and 2 and a smaller window. Test with the intended shader/rendering mods separately if using them.
12. Add ordinary and multi-region `.litematic` files through AutoBuilder's Open Folder action. Test selection, Refresh, previous/next, model rotation/zoom, world coordinates, rotation/mirror, ghost visibility, and Cancel Preview. A malformed file should show its reason and retain the last valid selection.
13. Compare material totals with single/double slabs, beds/doors/plants, hotbar and inventory stacks, partial builds, and unloaded chunks. In Creative, fill occupied inventory slots and verify Get Materials respects remaining capacity. Check the table remains responsive during a large schematic's Updating scan.
14. Build a small structure, directional blocks, and redstone states on a clear floor. Repeat with an obstacle, an elevated target, and top slab/stair side supports. Verify pause/resume for menus, Freecam, missing materials, and rejected placements. Confirm temporary supports remain reported for removal. Test your intended multiplayer server separately.
15. In an unlit room without Night Vision, toggle Fullbright and verify gamma 1000 makes the room visible. Disable it to restore normal brightness. Change the ordinary brightness setting while enabled, save/reload options, and confirm disabling uses that setting without saving gamma 1000 to `options.txt`.

Only checks actually executed are reported in the delivery message; this checklist is not a claim that every renderer/mod combination has been tested.
